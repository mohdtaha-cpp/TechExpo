A tool which will help women(or anyone in need) to notify there family members, friends and RAKSHAKS neerby and sending locations to them in difficult situations.

## Why We Built this
Keeping in mind the safety and security of women(or anyone in need).

## Key features 

1.Notification will be sent to contacts along with location

2.A unique feature of this tool will be that a community will be formed as RAKSHAKS who will also be notified if the case is in range of 500 m to 1 km from them so as to provide help at the earliest

3.RAKSHAKS community can also be joined by police stations hospitals etc.

## Limitations
Due to a lot of challenges ( being the first years having less knowledge of backhend and apis)  and time limitations we were not able to make working web sites.
